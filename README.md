## About Me


<!--**TLe1289/TLe1289** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.-->

Over the past few years, I've honed my skills in Python, Java, and C++, and have actively engaged in AI projects focusing on Computer Vision and Reinforcement Learning. My experience includes working under contract with professors and collaborating with PhD students on cutting-edge research that bridges the gap between theory and practical application.

I’m currently involved in projects that challenge me to innovate and push the boundaries of what's possible with AI, while also solidifying my software development expertise. My work has allowed me to explore the fascinating intersection of AI and software engineering, where I’m driven to create technologies that can make a meaningful impact.

As I continue to grow in my career, I aim to leverage my skills and experiences in a software engineering role, particularly in areas that intersect with AI and machine learning. I'm eager to connect with like-minded professionals and explore opportunities where I can contribute to and learn from innovative projects.

Feel free to connect with me if you’re interested in discussing potential collaborations, career opportunities, or the latest trends in AI and software engineering.
